### 🌟 Changelog

#### Version 2.0
- **New Structure:**
  - **Projects:** This directory contains all my individual projects, each with its unique focus and datasets.
  - **ML Models from Scratch:** This directory includes code for models written from scratch without relying on high-level libraries. These implementations focus on using fundamental mathematical concepts, utilizing only necessary libraries like NumPy and Pandas, and occasionally Seaborn (sns) and Matplotlib (plt) for plotting.

#### Version 1.0
- Initial version with a straightforward structure where data and models were directly added to the repository after being worked on.
